# Crypto Portfolio App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

PROBLEM:

I track my cryptocurrency holdings, but the price fluctuates often so it's difficult to get an updated price for each coin for the purpose of getting the total portfolio worth.

SOLUTION:

I created an app that obtains the prices for all cryptocurrencies within a portfolio.

HOW-TO-USE:

User can search for coins by name and add them to their portfolio. When added, the coin's most-recent price will be obtained, and any holdings of each coin will be multiplied by its price to obtain a total portfolio worth (in USD). User also has the ability to "refresh" their portfolio, which will obtain the most recent prices for all coins listed in their portfolio.
